# Hardware
This repository contains all the schematic and PCB information for RoboOne and its charger, described in full here.

http://www.meades.org/robots/robots.html

All the files are created in DipTrace, a schematic capture and PCB layout package.  The important files are:

- RoboOne*: the schematic and PCB layout files for RoboOne's main board.
- RoboOneWiring*: the wiring diagram showing how the RoboOne components are connected.
- RoboOneCharger*: a small schematic for a (vero) board used inside the RoboOne charger.

The libraries directory contains a number of components that had to be created for the RoboOne PCB layout.
